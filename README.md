# Work Study Scheme Data Scraping and Telegram Notification  
In this fun and practical project, I used Python to scrape data from my school's intranet to monitor new job postings in the Work Study Scheme. To streamline this process, I developed a Telegram bot that sends notifications directly to my Telegram account whenever new jobs are available. This automation significantly reduced the need for me to log in and check for updates manually, making my daily life more efficient. While it was a smaller project, it had a big impact on my routine by simplifying the job search process.
